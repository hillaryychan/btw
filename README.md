## The Plan/Vision

There are a few friends I catch up with sporadically, so I tend to write down a list of things that I want to talk/mention/discuss with them the next time I see them.

Normally, I'd have a checklist per person detailing what I'd like to talk about with them, but

* when I've talked about something (i.e. checked/crossed/completed it), it still exists on the checklist with a ~~strikethrough~~ and makes the list cluttered over time. I don't really need to see crossed out items **on** the list itself, but I may want to view it at a later point
* there have been times where I want to talk about the same thing to multiple people and I have to copy the same idea over multiple checklists
* sometimes I have a lot to say about an idea an need more than one line to express it. Sure we can have sub-items, but that doesn't work for rambling thoughts and musings that are meant to supplement my idea instead of being an extra sub-idea I want to point out

Basically, I want a glorified checklist with

* better handling of completed items
* better handling of one idea for multiple people
* better handling of complicated thoughts/ideas
