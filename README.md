# btw - by the way

A strange combination of a note taking app and a to-do list.

## Development

### Requirements

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Setting up

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies

    ``` sh
    yarn install
    ```

Useful commands:

* `yarn start` - for running app locally
* `yarn test` - for running tests (not that there are many...)
* `yarn lint` - for linting code
